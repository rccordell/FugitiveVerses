- I live for those that love me,
- {:.indent-1}For those I know are true,
- For the heaven that smiles above me,
- {:.indent-1}And awaits my spirit too;
- For all the human ties that bind me,
- For the task by God assign'd me,
- For the bright hopes left behind me,
- {:.indent-1}And the Good that I can do.


- I live to learn their story,
- {:.indent-1}Who've suffered for my sake,
- To emulate their glory,
- {:.indent-1}And follow in their wake;
- Bards martyrs, patriots, sages,
- The noble of all ages,
- Whose deeds crowd history's pages,
- {:.indent-1}And time's great volume make.


- I live to hail that season,
- {:.indent-1}By gifted minds foretold,
- When men shall live by reason,
- {:.indent-1}And not alone by goldâ€”
- When man to man united,
- And every wrong thing righted,
- The whole world shall be lighted,
- {:.indent-1}As Eden of old.


- I live to hold communion
- {:.indent-1}With all that is divine,
- To feel there is a union
- {:.indent-1}'Twixt Nature's heart and mine;
- To profit by affliction,
- Reap truths from fields of fiction,
- Grow wiser from conviction,
- {:.indent-1}And fulfill each great design.


- I live for those that love me,
- {:.indent-1}For those who know me true,
- For heaven that smiles above me,
- {:.indent-1}And awaits my spirit too;
- For the wrong that needs resistance,
- For the cause that lacks assistance,
- For the FUTURE in the distance,
- {:.indent-1}And the good that I can do.
