- {:.indent-3}Tell me, ye winged winds,
- {:.indent-4}That rounds my pathway roar,
- {:.indent-3}Do ye know some spot
- {:.indent-4}Where mortals weep no more?
- {:.indent-3}Some lone and pleasant dell,
- {:.indent-4}Some valley in the west,
- {:.indent-3}Where, free from toil and pain,
- {:.indent-4}The weary soul may rest?
- The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,
- And sighed for pity as it answered "No!" 


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, thou mighty deep,
- {:.indent-4}Whose billows round me play,
- {:.indent-3}Know'st thou some favored spot,
- {:.indent-4}Some island far away,
- {:.indent-3}Where weary man may find
- {:.indent-4}The bliss for which he sighs,
- {:.indent-3}Where sorrow never lives,
- {:.indent-4}And friendship never dies?
- The loud waves rolled in perpetual flow,
- Stopped for a while, and sighed, to answer "No!"

- {:.indent-3}And thou, serenest moon,
- {:.indent-4}That with such holy face,
- {:.indent-3}Dost look upon the earth
- {:.indent-4}Asleep in night's embrace,
- {:.indent-3}Tell me, in all thy round,
- {:.indent-4}Has thou not seen some spot,
- {:.indent-3}Where miserable man,
- {:.indent-4}Might find a happier lot.
- Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in wo,
- And a voice sweet, but sad, responded "No!"

- {:.indent-3}Tell me my secret soul,
- {:.indent-4}Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,
- {:.indent-3}Is there no resting place
- {:.indent-4}From sorrow sin and death;
- {:.indent-3}Is there no happy spot
- {:.indent-4}Where mortals may be bless'd,
- {:.indent-3}Where grief may find a balm,
- {:.indent-4}And weariness a rest?
- Faith, Hope, and love, best boons to mortals given,
- Wav'd their bright wings, and whispered, "Yes in Heaven."

"A Parody" by An Old Bachelor
from <em>The Grand River Times</em> (Grand Haven, Michigan), 4 March 1857


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, ye winged winds,
- {:.indent-3}That rounds my pathway roar,
- {:.indent-3}Do ye not know some spot
- {:.indent-3}Where women fret no more?
- {:.indent-3}Some lone and pleasant dell,
- {:.indent-3}Some "holler in the ground,"
- {:.indent-3}Where babies never yell,
- {:.indent-3}And cradles are not found?
- The loud wind blew the snow into my face,
- And snickered as it answered—"Nary place."


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, thou misty deep,
- {:.indent-3}Whose billows round me play,
- {:.indent-3}Know'st thou some favored spot,
- {:.indent-3}Some Island far away,
- {:.indent-3}Where weary men may find
- {:.indent-3}A place to smoke in peace,
- {:.indent-3}Were crinoline is not,
- {:.indent-3}And hoops are out of place!
- The loud waves, sounding a perpetual shout,
- Stopt for a while, and spluttered, "Yeou git eout."


- {:.indent-3}And thou serenest moon,
- {:.indent-3}That, with such holy face,
- {:.indent-3}Dost look upon the girls
- {:.indent-3}With their beaux embrace,
- {:.indent-3}Tell me, in all thy round,
- {:.indent-3}Hast thou not seen some spot
- {:.indent-3}Where muslin is not known,
- {:.indent-3}And calico is not?
- Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe,
- And a voice sweet but sad responded, "Pooh!"


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, my secret soul—
- {:.indent-3}Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,
- {:.indent-3}Is there no resting place
- {:.indent-3}From women, girls and death?
- {:.indent-3}Is there no happy spot
- {:.indent-3}Where bachelors are blessed,
- {:.indent-3}Where females never go,
- {:.indent-3}And may dwell in peace?
- Faith, Hope and Truth—best boons to mortals given—
- Waved their bright wings, and answered, "Yes, <em>in Heaven!</em>"

"A Parody Parodied"
from <em>The Evening Star</em> (Washington, D.C.), 23 June 1857
<p>Some fair writer thus retaliates on the parodist whose production we published some days since. Both sides must be heard, and we give the lady a chance:


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, ye winged winds
- {:.indent-3}The round my pathway roar,
- {:.indent-3}Do ye not know some spot
- {:.indent-3}Where bachelors come no more—
- {:.indent-3}Some lone and pleasant dell
- {:.indent-3}Where no moustache is seen—
- {:.indent-3}Where long eared dandies never come
- {:.indent-3}Ourselves and fun between?
- There came a murmur from the distant lee—
- A low, sad tone, which whispered 'No-sir-ee.'


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, thou misty deep,
- {:.indent-3}Whose billows round me play,
- {:.indent-3}Know'st thou some favored spot,
- {:.indent-3}Some island far away,
- {:.indent-3}Where weary girls may find
- {:.indent-3}A rest from soft dough faces,
- {:.indent-3}And hear themselves called women,
- {:.indent-3}Nor likened to the graces?
- Soon did the misty deep its answer give,
- By murmuring, "Not while brandy smashes live."


- {:.indent-3}And thou, serenest moon,
- {:.indent-3}What language dost thou utter
- {:.indent-3}While gazing on the GENTLEMAN,
- {:.indent-3}Whose head is in the gutter?
- {:.indent-3}Say, hast thou in thy round
- {:.indent-3}Gazed on some favored spot,
- {:.indent-3}Where <em>hats know not the weight of bricks</em>,
- {:.indent-3}And where cigars are not?
- Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe,
- But in italics answered, "<em>No, no, no!</em>"


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, my secret soul—
- {:.indent-3}Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,
- {:.indent-3}Is there no resting place
- {:.indent-3}From fops and beaux and death?
- {:.indent-3}Is there no happy spot,
- {:.indent-3}Where womankind are blest—
- {:.indent-3}Where man may never come,
- {:.indent-3}And where the girls may rest?
- Faith, Truth, and Hope—best boons to mortals iven,
- Waved their bright wings and answered "Yes, in Heaven."
