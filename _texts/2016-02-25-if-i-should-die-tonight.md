- {:.indent-2}If I should die to-night,
- My friends would look upon my quiet face,
- Before they laid it in its resting place,
- And deem that death had left it almost fair;
- And, laying snow white flowers against my hair,
- Would smooth it down with tearful tenderness,
- And fold my hands with lingering caress,
- Poor hands, so empty and so cold to-night!


- {:.indent-2}If I should die to-night,
- My friends would call to mind, with loving thought.
- Some kindly deed the icy hand had wrought;
- Some gentle word the frozen lips had said;
- Errands on which the willing feet had sped,
- The memory of my selfishness and pride,
- My hasty words, would all be put aside,
- And so I should be loved and mourned to-night.


- {:.indent-2}If I should die to-night,
- Even hearts enstranged would turn once more to me,
- Recalling other days remorsefully;
- The eyes that chill me with averted glance
- Would look upon me as of yore, perchance,
- And soften in the old, familiar way,
- For who could war with dumb, unconscious clay?
- So I might rest, forgiven of all, to-night.


- {:.indent-2}Oh, friends, I pray to-night,
- Keep not your kisses for my dead, cold brow,
- The way is lonely, let me feel them now,
- Think gently of me; I am travel worn;
- My faltering feet are pierced with many a thorn,
- Forgive, oh, hearts estranged, I plead!
- When dreamless rest is mine I shall not need
- The tenderness for which I long to-night.
