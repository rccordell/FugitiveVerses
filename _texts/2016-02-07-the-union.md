- Thou, too, sail on, O ship of State!
- Sail on, O Union, strong and great!
- Humanity, with all its fears,
- With all the hopes of future years,
- Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
- We know what master laid thy keel,
- What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,
- Who made each mast, each sail, each rope,
- What anvils sang, what hammers beat,
- In what a forge and what a heat,
- Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!
- Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
- 'Tis of the wave and not the rock;
- 'Tis but the flapping of the sail,
- And not a rent made by the gale!
- In spite of rock and tempest's roar,
- In spite of false lights on the shore,
- Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!
- Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee:
- Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, tears,
- Are all with theeâ€”are all with thee!
