- In speaking of a person's faults
- {:.indent-1}Pray don't forget your own;
- Remember, those with homes of glass
- {:.indent-1}Should seldom throw a stone;
- If we have nothing else to do
- {:.indent-1}But talk of those who sin,
- 'Tis better we commence at hoe,
- And from <em>that</em> point begin.


- We have no right to judge a man,
- {:.indent-1}Until he's fairly tried;
- Should we not like his company,
- {:.indent-1}We know the world is wide;
- Some may have faults—and who have not—
- {:.indent-1}The old as well as young;
- Perhaps we may, for aught we know,
- {:.indent-1}Have fifty to their one.


- I'll tell you of a better plan,
- {:.indent-1}And find it works full well;
- I try my own defects to cure
- {:.indent-1}Before of others tell;
- And though I sometimes hope to be
- {:.indent-1}No worse than some I know,
- My own shortcomings bid me let
- {:.indent-1}The faults of others go.


- Then let us all, when we commence
- {:.indent-1}To slander friend or foe,
- Think of the harm one word may do
- {:.indent-1}To those who little know;
- Remember, curses, sometimes like
- {:.indent-1}Our chickens, "roost at home;"
- Don't speak of others' faults until
- {:.indent-1}We have none of our own.
