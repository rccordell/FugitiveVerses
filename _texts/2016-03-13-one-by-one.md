- One by one the sands are flowing,
- {:.indent-1}One by one the moments fall;
- Some are coming, some are going,
- {:.indent-1}Do not strive to grasp them all.


- One by one thy duties wait thee,
- {:.indent-1}Let the whole strength go to each,
- Let not future dreams elate thee,
- {:.indent-1}Learn thou first what these can teach.


- One by one (bright gifts from Heaven,)
- {:.indent-1}Joys are sent thee here below;
- Take them readily when given,
- {:.indent-1}Ready, too, to let them go.


- One by one thy griefs shall meet thee,
- {:.indent-1}Do not fear an armed band;
- One will fade as others greet thee,
- {:.indent-1}Shadows passing through the land.


- Do not look at life's long sorrow;
- {:.indent-1}See how small each movement's pain;
- God will help thee for to-morrow:
- {:.indent-1}Every day begin again.


- Every hour that fleets so slowly,
- {:.indent-1}Has its task to do or bear;
- Luminous the crown, and holy,
- {:.indent-1}If thou set each gem with care.


- Do not linger with regretting,
- {:.indent-1}Or for passion hours despond;
- Nor, the daily toil forgetting,
- {:.indent-1}Look too eagerly beyond.


- Hours are golden links, God's token,
- {:.indent-1}Reaching Heaven; but one by one,
- Take them lest the chain be broken
- {:.indent-1}Ere the pilgrimage be done.
