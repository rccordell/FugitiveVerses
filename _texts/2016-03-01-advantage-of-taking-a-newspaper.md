- I knew two friends, as much alike
- {:.indent-1}As e'er you saw two stumps;
- And no phrenologist could find
- {:.indent-1}A difference in their bumps.


- One took the papers, and his life
- {:.indent-1}Was happier than a king's;
- His children all can read and write,
- {:.indent-1}And talk of men and things.


- The other took no papers, and
- {:.indent-1}While strolling through the wood,
- A tree fell down upon his crown,
- {:.indent-1}And hurt him, as it should!


- Had he been reading of the news
- {:.indent-1}At home, like neighbor Jim,
- I'll bet a cent this accident
- {:.indent-1}Would not befallen him!
