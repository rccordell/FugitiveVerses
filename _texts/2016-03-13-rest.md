- My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired—
- {:.indent-3}My soul oppressed—
- And with desire have I long desired
- {:.indent-3}Rest—only Rest.


- 'Tis hard to toil—when toil is almost vain
- {:.indent-3}In barren ways;
- 'Tis hard to sow, and never garner grain
- {:.indent-3}In harvest days.


- The burden of my days is hard to bear—
- {:.indent-3}But God knows best.
- And I have prayed—but vain has been my prayer,
- {:.indent-3}For Rest—sweet Rest.


- 'Tis hard to plant in spring, and never reap
- {:.indent-3}The autumn yield;
- 'Tis hard to till—and when 'tis tilled to weep
- {:.indent-3}O'er fruitless field.


- And so I cry a weak and human cry,
- {:.indent-3}So heart oppressed;
- And so I sigh a weak and human sigh
- {:.indent-3}For Rest—for Rest.


- My way has wound across the desert years,
- {:.indent-3}And cares infest
- My path, and thro' the flowing of hot tears
- {:.indent-3}I pine for Rest.


- 'Twas always so; when still a child, I laid
- {:.indent-3}On mother's breast
- My wearied little head; e'en then I prayed,
- {:.indent-3}As now, for Rest


- And I am restless still; 'twill soon be o'er;
- {:.indent-3}For, down the West,
- Life's sun is setting, and I see the shore
- {:.indent-3}Where I shall Rest.
